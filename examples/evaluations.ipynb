Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition resulted in more than 800 works of virtually every genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral repertoire. Mozart is widely regarded as among the greatest composers in the history of Western music, with his music admired for its \"melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and texture\".\n",

      ">> - If you compare TensorFlow with its competitors, it lacks in both speed and usage.\n",
      ">> - It is not supported on Windows starting with TensorFlow 2.11. For using on Windows, you will need to install TensorFlow either in WSL2, or install tensorflow-cpu and, optionally, try the TensorFlow-DirectML-Plugin.\n",

      ">> - Strong community support and extensive documentation.\n",
      ">> - Research focused. New methods are implemented relatively fast and early.\n",
      ">> - Has easy to use multi-GPU support.\n",

      "Regardless of the joke from earlier, if your motivation is to get first insights and some familiarity with all the methodologies within the field of deep learning as a beginner, the recommendation about PyTorch holds. It is a library which can be classified as beginner-friendly due to its large community, well documented install guides, tutorials and developers documentation. Also 3rd party blogs, tutorials or machine learning repositories often use PyTorch. Since it is also very research focused, it is likely that the latest achievements in deep learning are available for PyTorch, which makes it for students very easy to try out and experiment on state-of-the-art algorithms.\n",

Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition resulted in more than 800 works of virtually every genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral repertoire. Mozart is widely regarded as among the greatest composers in the history of Western music, with his music admired for its \"melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and texture\".\n",

      "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 - 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition resulted in more than 800 works of virtually every genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral repertoire. Mozart is widely regarded as among the greatest composers in the history of Western music, with his music admired for its \"melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and texture\".\n",
