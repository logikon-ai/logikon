# Examples

The following example notebooks work with Logikon `0.2.0` and later. 

- [x] simple_health_check.ipynb
- [x] delib_agent_chat.ipynb
- [x] test_classifier.ipynb
- [x] test_logits_model.ipynb

The following example notebooks have been created with Logikon `0.1.*` and won't run with `>0.2.0`. We are planning to update them soon.

- [ ] [quickstart.ipynb]<!--(./quickstart.ipynb)--> - demonstrates configuration and basic usage of **Logikon `/\/`**.
- [ ] [metrics_artifacts_zoo.ipynb]<!--(./metrics_artifacts_zoo.ipynb)--> - showcases the different metrics and artifacts that can be created with **Logikon `/\/`**.
- [ ] [monitor_cot_workflow.ipynb]<!--(./monitor_cot_workflow.ipynb)--> - illustrates how to monitor the intermediary (chain-of-thought) reasoning processes of an advanced LLM app.
- [ ] [legal_hallucination_detection.ipynb]<!--(./legal_hallucination_detection.ipynb)--> - shows how to build your own metrics and evaluations on top of **Logikon `/\/`** artifacts (here: detect hallucinations by Legal AI).
